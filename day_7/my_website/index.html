    <h1>Welcome to Meat Snacks!</h1>
    <h2>The website dedicated to meat-centric cooking</h2>
    <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>Greetings and welcome!  Here at Meat Snacks we are excited to teach you about cooking great food.  From grilling and smoking, to searing and braising, we've got you covered.  We are a protein-heavy cooking site and want to teach you how to respect the animals you are going to consume.  Hope you're hungry.</p>
    <h3>What can we learn about food?</h3>
      <p>Before we get into the cooking, it is important to ask one question: What can we learn about food?  In short, everything.  Knowing how a single dish is made can give you insight into other cultures and their rich histories.  What are the ingredients and where did they come from?  How was this prepared?  What technologies and processes were used to prepare this meal?  All these questions can be answered by looking at a single plate.  It is important to have these things in the back of your mind while eating.  In this incredibly diverse world in which we live, many people's only connection to their ancestry is food.  Food can connect us in ways that most other things can't.  I may be an Asian-American living in white suburbia.  You might be a Somalian immigrant in Minneapolis.  One thing we can agree on is the intrinsic, heart warming value of a good Jucy Lucy.  Whether you're at a Superbowl party, a wedding, a Christmas celebration, even Ramadan; food is always going to bring people together.  And of all the food on this planet, one thing holds true: meat is king.
    <h3>Kitchen essentials</h3>
      <p>In order to cook anything, you need tools with which to cook.  I have compiled a list of basic tools and equipment to get you started:
        <ul>
          <li>Oven</li>
          <li>Stove</li>
          <li>Pots/Pans</li>
          <li>Cutting board</li>
          <li>A good knife</li>
        </ul>
      I am probably forgetting some things but this is the most basic set up you can use to still make great food.  It is very important to know your equipment and the only way to do this is by practicing.  Different ovens and stove ranges have a lot of variables that can affect performance.  An induction stove will distribute heat evenly where a gas range might heat unevenly.  A cast iron pan will hold heat longer than an aluminum pan.  There is no need to buy top of the line equipment if you are just starting out.  Let's be honest, you probably mess it up anyway and now your $200 non-stick pan is a $200 stick-to-everything pan.  That being said, the one tool I would invest in is a good knife.  Which brings us to our next section.

    <h3>Knives</h3>
      <h4>Types of Knives</h4>
        <p>A knife is a chef's most prized possession.  It is the one tool that you can't go without and there is no improvising or replacing the utility of a good chef's knife.  There are many different kinds of knives:
        <ol>
          <li>Chef's knife</li>
          <li>Paring knife</li>
          <li>Serrated or bread knife</li>
          <li>Boning knife</li>
        </ol>
      There are obviously many more, but this is mostly what you will find in store-bought knife block sets.  They are listed in order of use.  You will use a chef's knife more than any other knife on a day to day basis and can serve the purposes of all the other knives on this list.  Paring knives are used for smaller, more intricate cutting.  A bread knife is used for, you guessed it: bread!  And a boning knife is used to remove bones from proteins.  There are specific design elements that go into all of these that make them useful in their individual ways, but first and foremost is the chef's knife.
      </p>
      <h4>Knife care</h4>
        <p>If I haven't made this point yet, knives are incredibly important in a kitchen and must be cared for as such.  You should never put a knife in a dishwasher.  Carefully hand wash and dry.  Store with an edge guard or in a block.  ONLY use a knife for cutting.  It is not a can opener!  If you take care of your knife, it will last a lifetime.  Proper honing and sharpening techniques also help keep your knife in great condition.
        </p>
      <h4>Honing vs sharpening</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Honing straightens the fibers in the knife blade. This makes the knife cut with less resistance.</li>
        <li>Honing is done with a honing steel.  You should maintain a specific angle (15 degrees for Japanese knives, 20 degrees for German knives) and draw the blade toward you, sliding from the rear to the tip of the blade.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Sharpening removes material from the knife.  This will make your knife smaller over time and should only be done when the knife is dull.</li>
        <li>Sharpening is done on a whetstone.  There are different levels of grit to each stone.  You can start with a lower number grit and work your way up until you are satisfied with the sharpness.  Commonly used stones are 1000, 3000, and 6000.  Use the same angle to sharpen as you would to hone.</li>
      </ul>
